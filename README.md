I imported this data set off Kaggle then constructed the data table within Python using Data Dictionaries and Mapping through Pandas. Once the table was constructed I exported the file from Python into an Excel file and then ported it to Tableau. From there I created an interactive dashboard with a customizable moving average and a heat map that compared Temperature and Wind Speed along with Weather and Time inside the Tooltip. The dashboard offers actionable insights and highlihgts trends within the data.
